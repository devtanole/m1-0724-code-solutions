## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  -A: Functions are programming power tools. They are good for packing up code for reuse throughout a program, giving a name to a handful of code statements to make the code easier to read, and making code "dynamic", meaning that it can be written once to handle many (or even infinite!) situations. They create reusable blocks of code.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A: define with function keyword, name function and use (), which can hold optional parameters. After, place code block in curly braces. Return statement optional.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A: Typethe function's name with its argument placed in ()
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A: calling executes the code block. when calling, there is no parameter there is an argument.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A: an argument is used to execute code block. parameters are placeholders.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  A: They act as placeholders like a variable until we need to call the function and pass an argument.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A: No further code is ran after the return statement. Return makes the function produce a value.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  A: declare like a variable, no need for function keyword and use =>. Implicit return statement, no need for {}

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  A: There is an inherent returns statement.
